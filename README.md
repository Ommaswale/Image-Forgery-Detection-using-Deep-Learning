# Image-Forgery-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
I have created and trained a deep learning model that learned from the ELA of images and uses neural network to classify the images as Real or Fake.

This model is trained on CASIA 2.0 dataset. In the frontend, Flask, html, css, javascript is used. Using the 'model02.ipynb' notebook, the model can be easily trained and saved in '.h5' extension to use with the front end.
